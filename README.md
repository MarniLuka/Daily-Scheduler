# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For this task, we had to update the functionality of a daily scheduler from a given starter code. This simple calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Each text box will also change color depending on the current time of the day. This calendar runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Dayjs.


## Usage

This simple [scheduler](https://marniluka.github.io/Daily-Scheduler/) will help busy people in their daily life. They can add in hourly tasks and save them when clicking the corresponding save button. This way, even if the website is refreshed or accidentally exited out of, the input will still be saved.
The colors for each task box will also change depending on the current time. Gray for past, red for present, and green for future.
